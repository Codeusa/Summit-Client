Summit-Client
=============

A windows desktop launcher for CodeUSA-RSPS


The project is open source under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://github.com/Codeusa/Summit-Client/blob/master/LICENSE).

###Why did I open source Summit?

CodeUSA has received some lackluster updates, so to help improve relationships with the community I felt it be a great move to allow users to make their own alterations to Summit to help contribute towards it and making it better, I've also started creating a brand new version of Summit and instead of just tossing this one to the side I figured I'd give great minds a chance to do something of their own with it.

###Note
